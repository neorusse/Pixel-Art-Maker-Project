## Project Description

Building of a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas!

## Instructions

The starter Template provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) includes all required HTML input fields, as well as some basic styling. A skeleton of the makeGrid() function is provided as well.

The Starter Template can be downloaded through either:

* [The Pixel Art Maker repository on GitHub](https://github.com/udacity/project-pixel-art-maker-starter)
* [This zipped folder](https://github.com/udacity/project-pixel-art-maker-starter/archive/master.zip)


## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
